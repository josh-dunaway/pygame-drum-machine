# pygame-drum-machine
Just started this project that is inspired by Pete LeMaster's video posted on freeCodeCamp.com's YouTube channel.

This code is monolithic and extremely messy in its current form. It in no way reflects the style that I want
to code in in the future.. but I just wanted to follow along a guide for a fun little project.

I may revisit it here and there to clean the code up.

Just toying around with different things until I find something that I really like.
